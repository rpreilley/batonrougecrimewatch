<h3>Problem to solve:</h3> 
<p>The problem I wanted to solve was the issue of city police station technology. It is outdated and can make it difficult to get information you may need quickly. I wanted people who use the app to be able to see populated areas of the city for specific crimes and get details about each one.

<p> While building the app I realized it could be valuable to families moving to cities who want to decide which part of town would be best to live in. The Socrata API was built out for a lot of major cities with the same API endpoints, so with a few changes in the code you can make the app work for cities other than Baton Rouge.


<h3>How I solved it:</h3>

<h3>Technologies I used:</h3>

We build this app using the following technologies:
    -Express.js
    -Node.js
    -React.js 
    -Bootstrap
    -Google Maps API
    -Socrata Open Data API for the City of Baton Rouge

<h3>Instructions on how to use app:</h3>

Select a crime from the drop down menu that you want to place markers on the map for and hit "Search"

Click on a marker to open a modal and get more information about that specific crime.
You can click out of the modal or click the "x" to close the modal and continue to click others or search for a different crime type to re-render a fresh map with fresh markers.
